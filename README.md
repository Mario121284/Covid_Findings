# COVID-19 Data Analysis: Deaths & Vaccinations Dashboard

This repository showcases a comprehensive data analytics project using two key COVID-19 datasets: `covid_deaths` and `covid_vaccinations`. The project explores pandemic trends globally from 2021 to 2022, leveraging Excel, SQL (via Google BigQuery), and Tableau to reveal insights that support healthcare monitoring and policy-making.

## Datasets Overview

### `covid_deaths`
This dataset records COVID-19-related fatalities with a geographic and temporal lens.  
**Key Metrics**:
- Total and daily COVID-19 cases  
- Total and daily deaths  
- Deaths per population  
- Organized by country, continent, and date

### `covid_vaccinations`
This dataset provides vaccination data across countries and continents.  
**Key Metrics**:
- Total vaccinations  
- Daily vaccinations  
- Vaccinations per population  
- Includes vaccine type and source notes

**Time Period Covered**: 2021–2022  
**Geographic Scope**: Global (by country and continent)

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Excel**: Data cleaning (e.g., `PROPER`, `TRIM`, `IF`, de-duplication)  
- **SQL (Google BigQuery)**: Querying, filtering, aggregations, joins, and window functions  
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards, KPIs, maps, area graphs, and timelines

## Tableau Dashboard Components

A dynamic Tableau workbook (`Covid-19 Dashboard Luis Carabajo.twbx`) visualizes major metrics and time-based patterns.  

**Dashboard Highlights**:
- KPI Cards: Total cases, total deaths, total vaccinations  
- Text Chart: Country/region totals  
- Symbol Map: Percent of population that died per country  
- Area Graphs:
  - COVID cases over time by continent  
  - Deaths over time by continent  
  - Vaccinations over time by continent

## Insights and Purpose

This project answers essential questions such as:
- Which regions experienced the highest death rates?
- How effective were global vaccination efforts over time?
- Are there correlations between cases, deaths, and vaccinations across continents?

It demonstrates the use of synthetic COVID data to simulate real-world healthcare reporting, guiding:
- Public health responses  
- Government policy  
- Academic research

## Relevance to Healthcare Analytics

These datasets provide a strong foundation for:
- Pandemic trend monitoring  
- Vaccine effectiveness evaluation  
- Healthcare system readiness analysis

This kind of data-driven insight is vital for decision-makers, data analysts, and researchers in the healthcare sector.

# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis: Deaths & Vaccinations Dashboard

This repository showcases a comprehensive data analytics project using two key COVID-19 datasets: `covid_deaths` and `covid_vaccinations`. The project explores pandemic trends globally from 2021 to 2022, leveraging Excel, SQL (via Google BigQuery), and Tableau to reveal insights that support healthcare monitoring and policy-making.

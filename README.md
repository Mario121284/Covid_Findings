    <h1>COVID-19 Datasets Overview</h1>
    <p>This document provides an introduction to the COVID-19 datasets, specifically the <code>covid_deaths</code> and <code>covid_vaccinations</code> datasets, which are organized by country and continent and cover the period from 2021 to 2022. These datasets are valuable resources for understanding the impact of the pandemic, evaluating vaccination efforts, and informing public health strategies.</p>    
    <h2>Introduction to the COVID-19 Datasets</h2>
    <p>The COVID-19 datasets provide detailed insights into the global impact of the pandemic, focusing on two key aspects: deaths and vaccinations. These datasets are structured by geographical location (country and continent) and cover the time frame from 2021 to 2022. They are essential for analyzing the spread of the virus, assessing vaccination campaigns, and supporting decision-making in healthcare and policy development.</p>
    <h2>Description of the <code>covid_deaths</code> Dataset</h2>
    <p>The <code>covid_deaths</code> dataset contains information about COVID-19-related deaths across different countries and continents. Key features of this dataset include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Geographical Breakdown:</strong> Data is organized by country and continent, allowing for regional and global analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Frame:</strong> The dataset covers the period from 2021 to 2022, providing a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> Includes metrics such as total deaths, daily deaths, and death rates per population.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Description of the <code>covid_vaccinations</code> Dataset</h2>
    <p>The <code>covid_vaccinations</code> dataset provides detailed information about COVID-19 vaccination efforts worldwide. Key features of this dataset include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Geographical Breakdown:</strong> Data is organized by country and continent, enabling analysis of vaccination progress at different levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Frame:</strong> The dataset covers the period from 2021 to 2022, reflecting the rollout and impact of vaccination campaigns.</li>
        <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> Includes metrics such as total vaccinations, daily vaccinations, vaccination rates, and types of vaccines administered.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Relevance of the Datasets to Healthcare</h2>
    <p>These datasets are highly relevant to healthcare for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Understanding the Spread of the Virus:</strong> The <code>covid_deaths</code> dataset helps track the severity and spread of COVID-19 across regions.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluating Vaccination Efforts:</strong> The <code>covid_vaccinations</code> dataset provides insights into the effectiveness and reach of vaccination campaigns.</li>
        <li><strong>Identifying High-Risk Areas:</strong> Both datasets help identify regions with high infection and mortality rates, enabling targeted interventions.</li>
        <li><strong>Informing Decision-Making and Policy Development:</strong> Policymakers and healthcare professionals can use these datasets to make informed decisions and develop effective strategies.<
